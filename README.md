# CIL vs CVXPY

This repository contains several scipts that compare the solution of different imaging minimisation problems using the [Core Imaging Library](https://github.com/TomographicImaging/CIL) and [cvxpy](https://github.com/cvxpy/cvxpy).

## Imaging Problems

- Total Variation Denoising
- Total Generalised Variation Denoising
- Directional Total Variation Denoising

## Note

- In the cvxpy implementation, the Split Conic Solver is used by default
